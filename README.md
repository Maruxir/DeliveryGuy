## Plugins

To create the **scoreboard**, I used the *Firebase.database extension*,
the *Firebase.authentication* extension for the login page 

Also, in the Firebase SDK, there was a file "FirebaseCppApp-10_4_0.bundle" that was too big to be added to Github (>100MB).

For the text, I used *TextMesh Pro*.

## Development

I developed this game independently

- Unity version: **2021.1.27f1**
- IDE: **VisualStudio**

I initially began making commits and push to the "main" branch, but later changed to the "gitlfs" branch, which has now become my default branch.
